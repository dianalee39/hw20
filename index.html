          <h1>Immerse in Korea's History</h1>
          <img src="images/gyeongbokgung image.jpg">
          <p>Korea has 5 grand palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty and while all of them are magnificent in their own way, Gyeongbokgung (Palace) located in Seoul is by far the most visited. Although most people simply go and take a picture at the entrance, to truly learn about the historical significance of the palace, I would recommend earmarking it for a full day.</p>
          <p>1. Dress in traditional hanboks<br>
            2. Have tea and a traditional meal at the palace<br>
            3. Take pictures and witness the changing of the guards

          <h1>A Mix of History and Modernism</h1>
          <img src="images/bhv image.jpeg">
          <p>Bukchon Hanok Village is one of a few areas that have been remodeled to accommodate modernism while keeping Korea’s historical and traditional values. Hotels in this village have kept Korea’s traditional house builds but also implemented modern views; therefore, you can get to experience culture with modern-day amenities.</p>
          <p>1. Stop by the traditional teahouse<br>
            2. Learn more about the history of Bukchon at their cultural center<br>
            3. Visit their most famous coffee shop: Cafe Onion

               <h1>The “Hawaii” of Korea</h1>
               <img src="images/jeju island image.jpeg">
               <p>Jeju Island is the largest tropical island in South Korea and while it is only a 5 hour flight from Korea’s mainland to Jeju Island, most Korean natives have talked about it still being considered a luxury to take time off work to travel this “short” distance. Jeju Island was dubbed one of the new 7 Wonders of the World and it can surely be seen from their waterfalls, volcanoes, and one-of-a-kind eateries.</p>
               <p>1. Hike Hallasan and see Jeju from its tallest peak<br>
                2. Visit the Cheonjeyeon Falls<br>
                3. Eat Jeju’s famous black pork (heuk dwaeji)

              <h1>Being One with the Locals</h1>
              <img src="images/hangang image.jpeg">
              <p>One of the biggest fascinations that tourists have come to experience in Korea when staying for long periods of time is the innovation of technology as well as amenities being available on every corner block. Do what the locals do and stray away from tourist traps by visiting local favorites.</p>
              <p>1. Play games and eat at a PC bang<br>
              2. Order chicken for delivery and eat it by the Hangang (River)<br>
             3. Spend the night at a jjimjilbang (sauna)
